# Eriq John Mendoza | Portfolio

My first portfolio built using vue cli.
I designed everything with bootstrap-vue and sass.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

Special thanks to https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/ for the svg background images.
